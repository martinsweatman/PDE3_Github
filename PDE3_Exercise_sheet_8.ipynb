    "The practice questions are similar to the exercises in the textbook and in Schaum's outlines Partial Differential Equations. If you are having difficulties with these questions practice using the remaining questions from these exercise. You will get the best from this tutorial by working though these examples __before__ the tutorial and asking your tutors to help you with questions with which you are having problems.\n",
